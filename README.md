2FAT2FURIOUS2 - A GBA game I made in CS2110
--------
Overview
--------
You play as a shy guy trying to navigate a maze of broccoli in order to press buttons in the right order that will open the fridge at the top of the screen.

You only have a limited amount of time to open the fridge.

Before each level starts, a screen will show you which buttons need to be pressed in what order to open the fridge as well as the time you have to do it in.

To press a button, simply walk over it.

You can also place down shadows of yourself (up to 2 at once) that you can use to teleport back to in order to save time.

There are 2 levels for you to beat. Good Luck!

Controls

2FAT2FURIOUS, a gba game by Jesse Chen



Most of the code is in 2F2F2\main.c
I have provided a .gba file to run using a gameboy advance emulator.  
Or, compile and create the .gba file yourself by running "make" in a terminal in the 2F2F2 directory.
